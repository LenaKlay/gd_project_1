# Understanding the temporal and spatial spread of gene drive alleles through modeling

## Introduction

Artificial gene drive is a genetic engineering technology that could be used for the control of natural
populations. Gene drive alleles bias their own transmission and can therefore spread in a population
within a relatively small number of generations, even if they are deleterious. Understanding the
potential outcomes of this technology, including the modification and/or the eradication of a natural
population, is essential before real-world applications are considered.  

## Contents

This repository contains two main folders:  

1) `Determinist` for the deterministic simulations (PDE, reaction-diffusion),

2) `Stochastic` for the stochastic simulations (birth–death process with migration).

It also contains the pdf of my first article, as well as my PhD final presentation.

## Authors

I (Léna Kläy) wrote the code but this project was carried out in collaboration with Florence Débarre, Vincent Calvez and Léo Girardin.
